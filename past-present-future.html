    Konstantin Marinov Past, Present, and Future
  </h1>
    <h2><b>Past</b> </h2>
    <p>
      My name is Konstantin Ivaylov Marinov. I was born in Sofia, Bulagaria on May 3rd, 1992. I will be 24 years
      old this year. I have a younger sister named Anna. When I was three years old my father, Ivaylo, came to
      America. My mother, Irina, moved to America the year after. My sister and I were taken care of by our
      grandparents until we were able to come to America ourselves. In October of 1999 my sister and I were on a
      plane for the first time in our lives on our way to be reunited with our parents. From 1999 to 2006 we
      lived at 7520 North Claremont in Rogers Park. The building was owned by friends' of my parents who they
      knew from Bulgaria. I started first grade at George B. Armstrong. I attended that school until half way
      through seventh grade. My closest group of friends, who I still see frequently to this day, were made in
      those seven years. My family moved to Buffalo Grove because my parents wanted a better education for my
      sister and I. I finished off my second half of seventh grade and eighth grade at Cooper Middle School. From
      there, I went to Buffalo Grove High School for then next four years. In thinking about my future at the
      time, I wanted to be a plastic surgeon. However, that was quickly crossed off the list when I took biology
      and chemistry classes. My father owns a construction company and I worked with him several summers during
      high school and that is when I decided that I wanted to pursue architecture as my major at IIT. The summer
      before starting college was the first time I went back to Bulgaria since I had moved to America. My parents
      to this day have not been back yet.

    <h3><b>Present</b> </h3>
    <p>
      I got accepted to IIT's architecture program and started my college education in August of 2011. Five years
      and many life lessons learned, I am in my final semester at IIT and ready to graduate with a BS in
      architecture. Throughout the past three years I have had internships in my field starting with Laszlo
      Simovic Architects, LLC. From there I moved onto Studio Villanueva Architecture and this past November I
      started working at VOA Associates Inc. My hopes for after graduation is that I get a full time offer from
      VOA and can start my professional career with them. I am currently on a team called S.W.A.T. and we assist
      the other teams of the company with software issues and help them meet deadlines if they need more manpower.

      I am taking this class with the hopes of getting a basic understanding of coding and establishing an
      understanding of how all of that works. I believe it is essential to have at least a beginner's knowledge
      of the ins and outs of writing a well developed source code. From my understanding of the course we will be
      writing a website for ourselves and I would like to make mine into an online portfolio for my professional
      career to use after I graduate. I would like to include my updated resume along with renderings of work and
      a bio.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Future</b> </h3>
    <p>
      After graduation I am hoping I get a full time offer from VOA where I will be able to complete my IDP which
      is the program I need to go through in order to become a licensed architect. The requirements for becoming a
      licensed architect for the state of Illinois are 3,740 hours of experience in the field in different
      categories and passing the ARE, which is a 7 part exam. This summer however, before I really delve deep into
      the professional world, I plan on traveling a bit. I am planning a trip to Toronto for a music festival and
      to see the city. I also want to go back to Bulgaria for a little and see my family. As for after getting my
      license, I would like to eventually start my own practice. I want to design large residential homes and maybe
      some commercial properties. I am very excited to see what 2016 has in store for me.
